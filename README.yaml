  Here are examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
  ### Single Node
  ```hcl
      module "elasticsearch" {
        source                         = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-elasticsearch.git?ref=tags/0.12.0"
        name                           = "es"
        application                    = "clouddrove"
        environment                    = "test"
        label_order                    = ["environment", "name", "application"]
        domain_name                    = "clouddrove"
        enable_iam_service_linked_role = true
        security_group_ids             = ["sg-xxxxxxxxxxxx"]
        subnet_ids                     = ["subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxx"]
        elasticsearch_version          = "7.1"
        instance_type                  = "t2.small.elasticsearch"
        instance_count                 = 1
        iam_actions                    = ["es:ESHttpGet", "es:ESHttpPut", "es:ESHttpPost"]
        volume_size                    = 30
        volume_type                    = "gp2"
        advanced_options = {
          "rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index" = "true"
        }
      }
  ```
  ### Multi Node
  ```hcl
      module "elasticsearch" {

        zone_awareness_enabled         = true
        availability_zone_count        = 2
        elasticsearch_version          = "7.1"

        volume_size                    = 30
        volume_type                    = "gp2"
        advanced_options = {
          "rest.action.multi.allow_explicit_index" = "true"
        }
      }
